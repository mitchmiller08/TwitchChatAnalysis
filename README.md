# TwitchChatAnalysis
This is a project to investigate trends in Twitch chat behavior.  I am beginning with a measurement of chat positivity using sentiment analysis to correlate with: # of monthly users, # of monthly subscribers, and message frequency.  
The ultimate goal is to build a tool using Twitch API to allow streamers to get a real-time measurement of chat attitude so they can encourage users that demonstrate behavoir which is correlated with high user counts.  ex. good users get shoutouts, giveaway rewards, music suggestions, etc.

### TODO
- Make tool to measure trends in chat (eg. % positive, chat frequency, emote frequency, etc.)
- Correlate trends with quality metrics (eg. Users/month, subscribers/month, etc.)
- Plan streamer tool
- Make streamer tool

### DONE
- Investigate frequency of streams in available logs
- Make tool to download logfiles
